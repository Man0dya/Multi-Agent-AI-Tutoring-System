            Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
            It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
            
            Key concepts include:
            - Variables and data types (int, float, string, list, dict)
            - Control structures (if/else, loops, functions)
            - Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
            - File handling and modules
            
            Python is widely used in:
            - Web development (Django, Flask)
            - Data science (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
            - Artificial intelligence and machine learning
